# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a "Rock Paper Scissors" game, I programmed in C :)

Also, this is the first program in which I managed to feature a data saving algorithm, using basic file streaming to save Win-Loss data onto a text file.

Running the program should be easy, just make sure to have a C-Compatible compiler installed.

(This Project works best on Windows operating systems, it might not work on another os)

# Warning

Changing the contents of the save file might cause the program to not work as intended...
